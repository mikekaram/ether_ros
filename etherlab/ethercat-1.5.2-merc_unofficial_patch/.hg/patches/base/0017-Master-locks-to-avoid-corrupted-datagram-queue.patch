Master locks to avoid corrupted datagram queue.

Added master lock for domain queing, domain processing, send and receive
which is likely to be called by more than one application task. The
missing lock can result in a corrupted datagram queue and "x datagrams
UNMATCHED!" warnings in syslog. It can be argued wether or not this
locking mechanism instead should have been implemented in the application
processes.

These locks are skipped for RTDM, as in this case Linux locks are both
harmful and insufficient; RTAI/Xenomai locks must be used instead if you
have multiple cyclic tasks.
